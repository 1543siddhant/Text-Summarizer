#FOR LIB REF FOLLOW HERE : 
# transformers: Provides pre-trained transformer models (like BERT, GPT) for various NLP tasks (text classification, translation, summarization, etc.).
# transformers[sentencepiece]: Adds support for SentencePiece, a subword tokenizer used in some transformer models (e.g., T5, BART).
# datasets: A library for easily loading and preprocessing datasets for NLP tasks, often used with Hugging Face models.
# sacrebleu: A tool for computing BLEU score, a metric for evaluating machine translation quality.
# rouge_score: Computes ROUGE scores, used for evaluating text generation tasks like summarization.
# py7zr: Handles extraction of .7z compressed files, useful for working with large datasets.
# pandas: Used for data manipulation and analysis (e.g., cleaning, transforming datasets).
# nltk: Provides various NLP tools, including tokenization, stemming, and text processing utilities.
# tqdm: Displays progress bars for loops and tasks, often used during long-running processes like model training.
# PyYAML: Reads and writes YAML files, commonly used for configuration files.
# matplotlib: Used for data visualization, e.g., plotting model performance graphs.
# torch: The PyTorch library for deep learning, used to build and train NLP models.
# notebook: Jupyter notebook support for interactive development and documentation.
# boto3: AWS SDK for Python, used to interact with AWS services like S3 (e.g., for dataset storage).
# mypy-boto3-s3: Type annotations for the boto3 S3 API, helping with static type checking.
# python-box==6.0.2: A lightweight dictionary subclass that allows for accessing nested data using dot notation.
# ensure==1.0.2: Used to ensure the correct installation and versions of dependencies.
# fastapi==0.78.0: Web framework for building APIs, commonly used for serving machine learning models in production.
# uvicorn==0.18.3: An ASGI server used to run FastAPI applications.
# Jinja2==3.1.2: Templating engine, often used in FastAPI to generate HTML or dynamic content.
# -e .: Installs the current project in "editable" mode, which allows you to modify your project without reinstalling it.
